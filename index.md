[***Credit Risk Analysis***](https://github.com/Jacquedelest/Latihan-dengan-R/tree/Credit-Risk-Analysis) is a technique to find the value of loan risk that can be certified by the borrowers. In this technique, a risk assessment process is usually carried out before a loan is given, which is called *credit scoring* and *credit rating* to the borrowers.

The benefit of this credit scoring is that it minimizes the risk that can occur to the borrowing institution, which based on the results of this assessment will determine whether the loan application is accepted or rejected by the financial institution.

To calculate this credit risk, financial institutions usually use a predetermined standard calculation. However, what is increasingly becoming a trend is calculations using machine learning methods based on historical loan data. The application of machine learning methods in R using a decision tree algorithm called C5.0.

### Data Science in Retail: Market Basket Analysis

<div style="text-align: justify">The release of Google's BERT is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune pretrained BERT model for a classification task. Then I will compare BERT's performance with a baseline model, in which I use a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier. The transformers library helps us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art BERT model and yield an accuracy rate 10% higher than the baseline model.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I did Machine Learning Modelling for DQlab Telco customers churn using dataset from June 2020. The steps to be taken are Performing Exploratory Data Analysis, Doing Data Pre-Processing, Doing Machine Learning Modeling, and Determining the Best Model.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The algorithms tested are Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier</div>

### Detect Spam Messages: TF-IDF and Naive Bayes Classifier

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/detect-spam-nlp.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/detect-spam-messages-nlp/blob/master/detect-spam-nlp.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>
