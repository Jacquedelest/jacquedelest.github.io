## Data Science in Industry
These are my Data Science rehearsals.

### Data Science in Finance: Credit Risk Analysis

<div style="text-align: justify"> Credit Risk Analysis is a technique to find the value of loan risk that can be certified by the borrowers. In this technique, a risk assessment process is usually carried out before a loan is given, which is called *credit scoring* and *credit rating* to the borrowers.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The benefit of this credit scoring is that it minimizes the risk that can occur to the borrowing institution, which based on the results of this assessment will determine whether the loan application is accepted or rejected by the financial institution.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">To calculate this credit risk, financial institutions usually use a predetermined standard calculation. However, what is increasingly becoming a trend is calculations using machine learning methods based on historical loan data. The application of machine learning methods in R using a decision tree algorithm called C5.0.</div>

### Data Science in Retail: Market Basket Analysis

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/Jacquedelest/Latihan-dengan-R/tree/Market-Basket-Analysis)

<div style="text-align: justify">In retail, technological innovation is the automated analysis of thousands to millions of transaction data to find combinations of frequently purchased products together. From various case studies, this combined information can be used to increase sales by 18% to 60%. Besides being effective for increasing sales, this information can also be used to solve stock problems.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">This analysis process is known as Market Basket Analysis (MBA). And in the world of data science, a popular algorithm to support this process is Apriori.</div>

### Data Science in Marketing: Customer Segmentation

[![View on RStudio](https://img.shields.io/badge/RStudio-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=RStudio)](https://rpubs.com/jcarvallo/customer-segmentation)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/Jacquedelest/Latihan-dengan-R/tree/Customer-Segmentation)

<div style="text-align: justify">All businesses or business entities must have customers. Customers have specific characteristics, for example age 36 years and female. Actually, these characteristics can be further divided in more detail by profession, for example housewives and career women. And it is still further divided in more detail based on total spending for a year, province of residence, and others.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The more you recognize customer characteristics, the easier it will be to innovate products with the needs of these characters and conduct marketing communications. This process of dividing customer characteristics is called Customer segmentation. If this process is carried out on customer data manually, it will be difficult and time consuming, especially with large amounts and variations of data.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Fortunately, there are currently many automation processes for customer segmentation using various machine learning algorithms. Two of them are k-means and k-modes. Data Science in Marketing: Customer Segmentation focuses on understanding and using these two algorithms with a practical approach using the R programming language.</div>

### Data Science in Finance: Dimension Reduction

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/Jacquedelest/Latihan-dengan-R/tree/Dimension-Reduction)

<div style="text-align: justify">The release of Google's BERT is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune pretrained BERT model for a classification task. Then I will compare BERT's performance with a baseline model, in which I use a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier. The transformers library helps us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art BERT model and yield an accuracy rate 10% higher than the baseline model.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I did Machine Learning Modelling for DQlab Telco customers churn using dataset from June 2020. The steps to be taken are Performing Exploratory Data Analysis, Doing Data Pre-Processing, Doing Machine Learning Modeling, and Determining the Best Model.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The algorithms tested are Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier</div>

### Detect Spam Messages: TF-IDF and Naive Bayes Classifier

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/detect-spam-nlp.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/detect-spam-messages-nlp/blob/master/detect-spam-nlp.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>
