## Data Science in Finance: Credit Risk Analysis

[![View on RStudio](https://img.shields.io/badge/RStudio-Open_RStudio-blue?logo=RStudio)](https://rpubs.com/jcarvallo/credit-risk-analysis)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/Jacquedelest/Latihan-dengan-R/tree/Credit-Risk-Analysis)

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I was asked to analyze the credit customer dataset from DQLab and built a model for the dataset. The analysis I did was to look at the relationship between the variables and the risk_rating to find the risk tendency. The variables were going to be used for modelling. The model used was a decision tree algorithm from the C50 library.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The goal of this project is to use a decision tree algorithm to find rules, classify classes of credit customers, and apply models to new data.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is an analysis technique used by retail businesses to find strong product associations, or in other words find product packages that can have a major impact on sales.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I was asked to analyze the combination of DQLab Retail transaction products using the a priori algorithm. The purpose of this analysis is to obtain the association rule dataset.</div>

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/Jacquedelest/Latihan-dengan-R/tree/Customer-Segmentation)

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I had customer segmentation with R. The algorithm used in this project is the k-means algorithm. The several steps I had before implementing the algorithm were preparing the data, normalizing the <i>NilaiBelanjaSetahun</i> column, selecting the variables to be used, and finding the optimal cluster for k-means.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The ultimate goal of this project is to find customer clusters and name them according to characteristics of the clusters.</div>

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/Jacquedelest/Latihan-dengan-R/tree/Dimension-Reduction)

<div style="text-align: justify">In this reduction dimension, I learned about the theory of principal component analysis and exercises its application to credit scoring. Principal component analysis is a technique used to reduce the number of unnecessary variables as input to the algorithm without compromising the quality of the prediction.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In the practice, the several subject matters I did were data standardization, the correlation matrix, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors calculation, selection of the number of principal components, and data visualization.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The store manager and junior Data Analyst of DQLab Sport Center asked me to help out with their market research with the data and issues. While I was working, I created my work report step by step so that the data analysis process could be known to solve this case.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I wanted to have a churn analysis of products in one of the branches. My goal was to provide recommendations and strategies to reduce customer churn.</div>
