[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/Jacquedelest/Latihan-dengan-R/tree/Credit-Risk-Analysis)

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I was asked to analyze the credit customer dataset from DQLab and built a model for the dataset. The analysis I did was to look at the relationship between the variables and the risk_rating to find the risk tendency. The variables were going to be used for modelling. The model used was a decision tree algorithm from the C50 library.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The goal of this project is to use a decision tree algorithm to find rules, classify classes of credit customers, and apply models to new data.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is an analysis technique used by retail businesses to find strong product associations, or in other words find product packages that can have a major impact on sales.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I was asked to analyze the combination of DQLab Retail transaction products using the a priori algorithm. The purpose of this analysis is to obtain the association rule dataset.</div>

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/Jacquedelest/Latihan-dengan-R/tree/Customer-Segmentation)

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project, I had customer segmentation with R. The algorithm used in this project is the k-means algorithm. The several steps I had before implementing the algorithm were preparing the data, normalizing the <i>NilaiBelanjaSetahun</i> column, selecting the variables to be used, and finding the optimal cluster for k-means.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The ultimate goal of this project is to find customer clusters and name them according to characteristics of the clusters.</div>

## Data Science in Finance: Dimension Reduction

<div style="text-align: justify">In this reduction dimension, I learned about the theory of principal component analysis and exercises its application to credit scoring. Principal component analysis is a technique used to reduce the number of unnecessary variables as input to the algorithm without compromising the quality of the prediction.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In the practice, the several subject matters I did were data standardization, the correlation matrix, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors calculation, selection of the number of principal components, and data visualization.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I did Machine Learning Modelling for DQlab Telco customers churn using dataset from June 2020. The steps to be taken are Performing Exploratory Data Analysis, Doing Data Pre-Processing, Doing Machine Learning Modeling, and Determining the Best Model.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The algorithms tested are Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">DQLab Sport Center is a store that sells various sports needs such as jackets, clothes, bags, and shoes. The shop has been selling since 2013, so it has had regular customers for a long time, and is still trying to get new customers to this day. In early 2019, the store manager hired a junior Data Analyst to help solve the problem in his store, namely the decline in customers who buy back to his store. The Junior Data Analyst was also entrusted with processing the store's transaction data. The store manager defines that a customer is no longer called a customer (churn) when he has not transacted to his store again up to the last 6 months from the last available data update.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">So, the store manager and junior Data Analyst at one of the branches asked me to help out with their market research with the data and issues. It's good that while I'm working, I make my work report step by step so that the data analysis process can be known to solve this case.</div>
